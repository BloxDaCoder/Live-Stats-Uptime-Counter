# Live-Stats-Uptime-Counter
Are you using a free hosting service for your bot like Glitch or Heroku? Ever wanted to know how stable are they? Ever wanted to know is your bot being online 24 / 7? Well here you go! I've made a simple live stats uptime counter to let you know how stable is your bot and how long  has it been on! Made possible, developed &amp; released by me. Please do not remove the credits :D

All configuration to be ONLY done in config.json

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE CREDITS :((

Configuration Information : 

Interval - How fast do you want the bot to update your uptime. (In minutes ONLY)

guildID - The ID of the guild you want the bot to track your uptime in

token - The token of your bot

Support Information : 

I may or may not provide support but feel free to try your luck by DMing me on Blox_BlackJack#2373


Last Words :

Anyways, enjoy and have fun with this. It's a simple code but it's really helpful if you're ensuring your bot is online 24 / 7 :D Byee
